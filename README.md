# Tic
Code that searches for proteins with (period)ic interface-philicities

USAGE:
I don't expect this to be used by anyone else, ever, so I'll keep this brief.
Go into the 'run_parser.py' file and see what options you have. You have to specify
a fasta file (or similar) that can be read by Bio. There are lots of dependencies
but all are pretty common:
	numpy
	matplotlib
	os
	re
	scipy (can be avoided)
